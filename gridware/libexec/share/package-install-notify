# This script is invoked by Gridware's `package_requests` command when a user
# package install request is fulfilled by an administrator.

# By default, if sendmail is installed and a user email address has been
# configured in ~user/gridware/etc/gridware.yml, then an email is sent to that
# address with details of the request fulfillment.
# If no email address is supplied (or sendmail is not installed) then this
# script has no effect.
