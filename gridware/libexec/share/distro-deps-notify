# This script is invoked by Gridware's `install` command when a userspace
# installation requires distribution packages to be installed, and those
# packages have not been whitelisted in /opt/gridware/etc/whitelist.yml.

# By default, the script creates entries in /opt/gridware/etc/package-requests
# containing details of the request. Administrators (members of the `gridware`
# group) are notified of pending requests on login and can approve or reject
# them as desired. If sendmail is installed and an admin email address has been
# configured in $cw_ROOT/etc/gridware.rc then an email is sent to that address
# with details of the request.
