>> SYNOPSIS <<

Amazon S3 is a reasonably priced data storage service. Ideal for
off-site file backups, file archiving, web hosting and other data
storage needs. It is generally more reliable than your regular web
hosting for storing your files and images. Check out about Amazon S3
<http://s3tools.org/s3_about> to find out more.

S3cmd is a free command line tool and client for uploading, retrieving
and managing data in Amazon S3 and other cloud storage service
providers that use the S3 protocol, such as Google Cloud Storage or
DreamHost DreamObjects. It is best suited for power users who are
familiar with command line programs. It is also ideal for batch
scripts and automated backup to S3, triggered from cron, etc.
