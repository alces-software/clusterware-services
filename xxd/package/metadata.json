    "summary": "xxd - make a hexdump or do the reverse",
    "description": "xxd creates a hex dump of a given file or standard input. It can also convert a hex dump back to its original binary form. Like `uuencode` and `uudecode` it allows the transmission of binary data in a 'mail-safe' ASCII representation, but has the advantage of decoding to standard output. Moreover, it can be used to perform binary file patching.",
